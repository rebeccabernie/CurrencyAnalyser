**Notes**  
Referring to cryptocurrency as CC from here, will correct for submission. Traditional currency = TC.  

In recent years CC has grown from an unheard of concept into something everyone has heard of, more and more people buying/at least talking about it, features heavily in online news outlets, blog sites, reddit/hackernews/twitter etc. 

Unlike TC, based on world events/country status/economy/disasters/war etc, CC based solely on hype (? will look into it more later on). Functions more like a stock than actual currency. All digital, no physical currency. Decentralised (not in one place) unlike TC, centralised in banks etc. Security (ECC), blockchain.
